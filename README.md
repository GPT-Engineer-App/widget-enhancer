# widget-enhancer

Enhance the app to include an 'Add Widget' feature. This feature should allow users to: 1. Specify a widget title. 2. Choose the shape of the widget (options include textbox, rectangular button, circular button, or image). 3. Define an action that, when inputted, is sent to GPT Engineer for processing and reflected in the widget. The interface should be designed in a no-code format, focusing on user-friendly drag-and-drop elements and simple, intuitive options for customization.
